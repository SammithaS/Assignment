### Steps to run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   https://github.com/SammithaS/Assignment.git
   ```
3. Click on respective folder.
4. Navigate to root of project directory.
5. In the `code` directory create .env file and initialize your token.
6. Open terminal and enter these commands to run (Make sure you have `Node.js` in your system):

   ```
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run package
   ```
8. You can also test locally if you want to make any changes using this command:

   ```
   npm run start:watch -- --functionName=function_1 --fixturePath=function_1_event.json
   ```
10. You will see a `build.tar.gz` file is created and you can provide it while creating the snap_in_version.
11. Install following prequisites( Refer [DevRev documentation](https://developer.devrev.ai/about/for-developers) for more information):
  
   ```
   Install DevRev CLI
   Install jq
   Install DevRev SDK
   ```
11. To authenticate using `DevRev CLI`, run the following command:

     ```
    devrev profiles authenticate -o <dev-org-slug> -u <youremail@yourdomain.com>
    ```
13. To create a `snap-in package`, run the following command:

     ```
    devrev snap_in_package create-one --slug my-first-snap-in | jq .
    ```
15. To create a `snap-in version`, run the following command:

     ```
    devrev snap_in_version create-one --manifest manifest.yaml --archive build.tar.gz | jq
    ```
17. Now run:

     ```
    devrev snap_in draft
    ```
19. The snap-in is installed in draft state. It may require some configuration before it can be deployed.
    >In this case you have to enter priority which is used to assign priority automatically when the issue is created.
20. Once you have provided the required configuration, the Deploy snap-in button is enabled on the UI. Click on it to deploy the snap-in. Thatâ€™s it, the snap-in should now be active and ready to use.

8. Once test is successful you can run for production:

   ```
    npm run start:production -- --functionName=function_1 --fixturePath=function_1_event.json
   ```

**This snap-in is specifically developed for CLI which provides various features while cloning.**

* After it runs, you can enter two commands either `clone-work-item` or `clone-work-item m`.
* **clone-work-item** is used to create single work item either `ticket` or `issue`.
* **clone-work-item m** is used to create multiple work items at once.
* You can also choose between `ticket` or `issue` in the next step.
* It will ask whether you know the `work-id`; if not, it will provide a command to display a **list** of work items in CLI.
* Otherwise, it will ask for the `work-id` and proceed to cloning.
* After providing the work-id, it also has a feature to customize the properties. If you want to customize, you can; otherwise, it proceeds to cloning without customizing.
* In multiple cloning, you have to provide a list of work-ids separated by commas. It will clone every work-id provided in the command line.
